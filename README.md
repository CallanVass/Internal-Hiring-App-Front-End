### R1 - Website Description

### Purpose

The purpose of our internal hiring application is to provide a space for organisations and companies to advertise their positions internally before displaying them on job-listing websites. By providing this functionality, we're able to give employees a chance to display their ambitions. This works for the employer by lessening the costs (both time-wise and monetariy) associated with the hiring process, and for the employee by providing them a place to display their interest and ambition for a company position.
